<p>This is the Crystal collector game once the game is loaded a random target number between 19 and 120 is generated this is the target number.</p>

<p>The game will also generate four crystals each crystal will have a random value between 1 and 19. </p>

<p>The top box shows the target number.</p>

<p>The bottom box shows your current score of the added up crystal numbers.</p>

<p>After you win or loose the game the game will change the target values and gem values it will also zero out your score so you can go again.</p>
